## Status

- [x] RTVM runtime
- [x] RTVM annotation processor (Based on KSP)
- [x] RTVM example
- [ ] RTVM IntelliJ IDEA plugin (To generate RTVM code automatically in real-time. )

Your stars, issues, and PRs are the reflection of the engagement of the project. I will consider starting the implementation for the RTVM IntelliJ IDEA plugin after the project has reached a certain level of engagement.

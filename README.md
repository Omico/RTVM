# RTVM (Rethink MVVM)

RTVM is an improved Android architecture based on the Android MVVM architecture. For more info please see this document [Rethink MVVM (Draft, Chinese only for now) ](Rethink-MVVM.md). This document is distributed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0).

## Status

- [x] RTVM runtime
- [x] RTVM annotation processor (Based on KSP)
- [x] RTVM example
- [ ] RTVM IntelliJ IDEA plugin (To generate RTVM code automatically in real-time. )

Your stars, issues, and PRs are the reflection of the engagement of the project. I will consider starting the implementation for the RTVM IntelliJ IDEA plugin after the project has reached a certain level of engagement.
